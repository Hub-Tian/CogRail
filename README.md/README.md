# RailCog: Benchmarking VLMs for Cognitive Railway Intrusion Perception

## Project Overview

RailCog is the first multimodal benchmark and open-source framework dedicated to cognitive railway intrusion perception, built on real-world surveillance scenes with cognition-driven, multi-dimensional instruction-level annotations (the CogRail dataset). It supports spatio-temporal reasoning, motion prediction, and threat assessment for objects of interest (OOIs) in railway environments. The project integrates visual question-answer annotations with expert-defined threat semantics and leverages instance synthesis to enhance data diversity while maintaining consistent label space across subsets. RailCog systematically evaluates state-of-the-art vision-language models (such as Qwen-VL and LLaVA) in railway scenarios, revealing their strengths and limitations in complex spatio-temporal reasoning. It also introduces the RAILGPT multi-task fine-tuning framework, which combines visual prompts, textual instructions, and specialized agents to optimize cognitive capabilities across position awareness (RailPos), motion prediction (RailMove), and threat analysis (RailThreat) tasks. After joint fine-tuning, RAILGPT achieves an 18.6% F1 improvement on the threat analysis task, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured multi-task learning in safety-critical scenarios and providing a complete benchmark toolchain for both research and engineering applications.
